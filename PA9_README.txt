Description of the game:
Our group decided to make the game battle tanks. Battle tanks is a game similar to the Wii game Tanks! where two players drive their own tank
and attempt to shoot the other persons tank to kill them. Each player has three lives and the person whose lives run out loses. Each tank can 
move in eight directions and can shoot one bullet which can ricochet. There are obstacles scattered around the map that the 
tanks cannot drive through and the bullets will bounce off of. Once the bullet has ricocheted two times it will despawn and you will be 
able to shoot again. The game menu allows you to choose from the options: Instructions, Play Game, Test cases, and Exit.

Post Project thoughts:
Thankfully the entire group wanted to do this game and were all excited to code this project. We do think that we may have gotten a little
ambitious with what we wanted to implement into our game. Unfortunatley we ended up cutting out a lot of what we originally intended to do. 
We encountered and issue with opening textures and creating sprites. We took an entire day trying and get them to work and we compared code with other 
groups to see if we were doing something wrong but we could not find the problem. So sprites were out and we opted to draw our own shapes using SFML tools. 
As far as the final deliverable goes, we are all happy with the result and feel like we learned a lot through this assignment and processs.
